	Good afternoon everyone, glad to introduce our newly designed transport aircraft. The Hybrid-Wing-Body configuration, with enlarged capacity and higher efficiency, will dramatically reduce fuel cost, and is still compatible with todayâ€™s air mobility missions.
	It originates from the combination of traditional aircraft like C-5, and the novel blended-wing-body configuration. Both robust control effector and efficient lifting force body are embodied in this new configuration. In this way, it has better distribution of lift and span load, which ease the design of inner structures.
	Rapid Navier-Stokes CFD analysis, design and optimization process were involved. The design cycle starts from CAD lofting and the generation of unstructured meshes. CFD simulation follows and results were used for further optimization. Typically, our optimization procedure combines a global optimizer like NSGA-II and a local optimizer, which is gradient-based.
	The final optimization results was rather satisfactory, as the pressure distribution is well tuned. It shows about 65% improvement in terms of aerodynamic efficiency compared to C-5.
	I believe our new design will provide you a bright future!
