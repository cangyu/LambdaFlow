LVDT Signal Filtering: Given the spectrum of a time-varying core displacement, what effect does the choice of the primary excitation frequency have, how should be low-pass filter be designed to produce an output most representative of the displacement?  

Investigate  
    1) a typical configuration of an industrial resolver sensor (i.e., hardware and the conversion of signals from resolver to digital data);  
    2) major specifications;  
    3) pros and cons;  
    4) list morn than three examples of real applications (note: other than the applications in cars).
